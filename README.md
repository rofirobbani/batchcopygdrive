## üóÇÔ∏è How It Works

Create a Google Sheet with a sheet named `copyfile`. Use the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `link` | The link to the **source folder** you want to copy. |
| `folder_name` | Name of the new folder to be created in the destination. |
| `status` | Auto-filled by the script with success or error messages. |
| `timestamp` | Auto-filled with the time the copy operation was completed. |
| `IDFolder` | The **ID** of the destination folder in your Google Drive. |

Each row in the sheet triggers a new copy operation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

1. The script **does not support versioning or updating** files that already exist in the destination folder.
2. Execution is limited by **Google Apps Script's 6-minute time limit** (script is optimized for ~4 minutes).
3. The source folder must be accessible with at least **Viewer access** to copy its contents.

3. Create a sheet named `copyfile` and follow the structure above.
